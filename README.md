# fra_races

This repo contains a (.ics) calendar file containing details of fell races (mostly) in England as listed on the Fell Runners Association (FRA) website. Hopefully the calendar will be updated relatively regularly (aiming for the 1st of each month). There is also the python script used to generate the code. It's not commented and rather poor.

I should add this repo is completely unofficial and nothing to do with the FRA. For full up to date information, you should consult the FRA handbook and/or the online calendar at https://races.fellrunner.org.uk/races/. There is some missing information, so I'd suggest using the "official" means to check. I've set the start time to the time listed on the calendar, with a duration of two hours for all events.

# Adding fell races to your personal (Google, Outlook etc) calendar:

This is probably why you're here. There are 300+ races scheduled in 2022 so far so bear in mind how clogged your calendar might be.

## Google (web).
Not found a way to do it on mobile yet, but it'll sync across to your phone if you've got a Google Calendar

1. Copy the following link https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdconey/fra_races/main/fra_calendar.ics
2. On the Google Calendar Sidebar, click the plus (+) button next to 'Other Calendars'
3. In the dropdown, click on 'From URL'
4. Paste the link you copied from step 1 into the box, then 'Add Calendar'
5. Done, if you click on the three dots next to the calendar in your sidebar, then 'Settings' you can muck around with the settings and change the name.

I think Google sorts other calendars by name so bear that in mind (maybe put a 'z' or something at the start of the name) so it doesn't clog up your calendar with events.
If you get bored with this the three dots menu, then Settings has the option to unsubscribe from the calendar (right at the bottom of the page of settings).

## Outlook.com
1. Copy the following link https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdconey/fra_races/main/fra_calendar.ics
2. On the Calendar screen, click on 'Add Calendar' on the sidebar
3. Click on 'Subscribe from web'
4. Paste the link you copied in Step 1 and click 'Import'
5. You'll now have the option to give the calendar a name, colour and 'charm'.

You can remove the calendar at any time by clicking on the three horizontal dots next to the calendar's name, and then clicking 'Remove'
