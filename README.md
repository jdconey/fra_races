# fra_races

This repo contains a (.ics) calendar file containing details of fell races (mostly) in England as listed on the Fell Runners Association (FRA) website. Hopefully the calendar will be updated relatively regularly (aiming for the 1st and 14th of each month). There is also the python script used to generate the code. It's not commented and rather poor so folk who are more talented can have a go at making a less bad job of it that I. I think I've caught most of the issues that might cause the creation of the calendar file to break (mainly to do with date/time - some races don't have one - which is good -, and location (for some reason it just won't behave so I've left the exact location out. Look on the web though). There is some missing information and/or races, so I'd suggest using the "official" means to check. I've set the start time to the time listed on the calendar, with a duration of two hours for all events.

I should add this repo is completely unofficial and nothing to do with the FRA. For full up to date information, you should consult the FRA handbook and/or the online calendar at https://races.fellrunner.org.uk/races/. You do not have to be a member of the FRA, or a running club in order to race in most fell races (exceptions include things like relay events).

That said, I think if you are interested in fell running in England, then you should definitely consider joining the FRA (similar organisations exist in Wales (Welsh Fell Runners Association) and Scotland (Scottish Hill Runners)). For Â£16 a year, you get three quality Fellrunner magazines through the post, a printed copy of the fixtures calendar, first dibs for entry to English Championship races, as well as some races offering you cheaper entry. The FRA also wants to protect the fragile upland environment from our sport, and also works to ensure that in the face of large, expensive, commercial "trail"/"mountain"/"skyrunning" events that there is a place in the future for cheap, non-commercial, low-key fell races.

## New

I've now added the BOFRA race calendar as a separate file. This is likely to break at any time due to the particular formatting on the BOFRA website. There's some cross posting with some races appearing on both the FRA and BOFRA calendar. All BOFRA races have (BOFRA) after the name of the race. More information on http://bofra.org.uk/. 

# Adding fell races to your personal (Google, Outlook etc) calendar:

This is probably why you're here. There are 300+ races scheduled in 2022 so far so bear in mind how clogged your calendar might be.

## Google (web).
Not found a way to do it on mobile yet, but it'll sync across to your phone if you've got a Google Calendar

1. Copy the following link https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdconey/fra_races/main/fra_calendar.ics
2. On the Google Calendar Sidebar, click the plus (+) button next to 'Other Calendars'
3. In the dropdown, click on 'From URL'
4. Paste the link you copied from step 1 into the box, then 'Add Calendar'
5. Done, if you click on the three dots next to the calendar in your sidebar, then 'Settings' you can muck around with the settings and change the name.

I think Google sorts other calendars by name so bear that in mind (maybe put a 'z' or something at the start of the name) so it doesn't clog up your calendar with events.
If you get bored with this the three dots menu, then Settings has the option to unsubscribe from the calendar (right at the bottom of the page of settings).

## Outlook.com
1. Copy the following link https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdconey/fra_races/main/fra_calendar.ics
2. On the Calendar screen, click on 'Add Calendar' on the sidebar
3. Click on 'Subscribe from web'
4. Paste the link you copied in Step 1 and click 'Import'
5. You'll now have the option to give the calendar a name, colour and 'charm'.

You can remove the calendar at any time by clicking on the three horizontal dots next to the calendar's name, and then clicking 'Remove'.
